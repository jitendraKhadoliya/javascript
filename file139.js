// basic theory 

// AJAX : asynchronous javaScript and XML

// this does HTTP request 

// is a set of "web application techniques"
// using many web technology on the "client-side"
// to create asynchronous web application

// with AJAX, web application can send and retrieve
// data from a server asynchronusly( in the background)
// without interfering with the diaplay and
// behaviour of the existing page

// we don't use data in XMl format anymore.
// we use JSON now

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2.) fetech API (new way of doing)
// 3.) axios (this is third party library)
